      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Ishita. I'm from Houston, Texas, and currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at 
          Texas A&M University. From a young age, I've been curious about how technology works behind the scenes, and having 
          taken several coding and computer science classes in high school, it led me to further pursue studies in this field. 
          As I have been working with programming and similar fields for many years, I have become passionate about software 
          engineering and development. What interests me the most about engineering is that I have the opportunity to combine 
          my creative and logistical skills to design solutions to real-world problems that have a lasting impact. Overall, my 
          biggest strengths include breaking down complex challenges into smaller, more manageable steps while also communicating 
          ideas clearly. I enjoy working on projects that are challenging and collaborative, where I'm able to work with people 
          and learn something new.
          I've completed a few internships over the past few summers, which have given me extensive hands-on experience within 
          different fields, such as engineering, cybersecurity, and ERPs. Outside of work and school, I try to maintain a good 
          balance between my hobbies and physical activities. I love playing sports or working out, as well as unwinding by 
          watching shows and movies. My favorite ones recently have been Breaking Bad and Good Girls on Netflix.
          Looking ahead, I hope to continue developing my skills as both an engineer and a problem solver, while contributing 
          to meaningful projects where I can collaborate with a team and make a difference. I'm passionate about teaching and 
          making education accessible to everyone around the world. I've done some volunteer work teaching students in other 
          countries English as a second language, including English speaking and grammar. This has been a really good experience 
          for me, and I'm excited to use my skills as a software engineer to further work towards this goal.
