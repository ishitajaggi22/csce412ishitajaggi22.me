  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Ishita. I'm from Houston, Texas, and currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at 
    Texas A&M University. From a young age, I've been curious about how technology works behind the scenes, and having 
    taken several coding and computer science classes in high school, it led me to further pursue studies in this field. 
    As I have been working with programming and similar fields for many years, I have become passionate about software 
    engineering and development. What interests me the most about engineering is that I have the opportunity to combine 
    my creative and logistical skills to design solutions to real-world problems that have a lasting impact. Overall, my 
    biggest strengths include breaking down complex challenges into smaller, more manageable steps while also communicating 
    ideas clearly. I enjoy working on projects that are challenging and collaborative, where I'm able to work with people 
    and learn something new.
  </p>

  <p> 
    I've completed a few internships over the past few summers, which have given me extensive hands-on experience within 
    different fields, such as engineering, cybersecurity, and ERPs. Outside of work and school, I try to maintain a good 
    balance between my hobbies and physical activities. I love playing sports or working out, as well as unwinding by 
    watching shows and movies. My favorite ones recently have been Breaking Bad and Good Girls on Netflix.
  </p>

  <p>
    Looking ahead, I hope to continue developing my skills as both an engineer and a problem solver, while contributing 
    to meaningful projects where I can collaborate with a team and make a difference. I'm passionate about teaching and 
    making education accessible to everyone around the world. I've done some volunteer work teaching students in other 
    countries English as a second language, including English speaking and grammar. This has been a really good experience 
    for me, and I'm excited to use my skills as a software engineer to further work towards this goal.
  </p>
