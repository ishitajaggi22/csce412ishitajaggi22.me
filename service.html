    Service and Community Involvement
  </p>

  <h2>Peer Tutoring</h2>
  <p>
    I try my best to help my peers understand challenging concepts, 
    especially in math and computer science courses, like data structures, programming, 
    and computer systems. Explaining ideas in different ways not only helps others but also strengthens 
    my own understanding.
  </p>

  <h2>Study Groups</h2>
  <p>
    I enjoy participating in collaborative study sessions where I share resources, 
    walk through coding examples, and answer questions. These group settings create 
    a supportive environment and encourage everyone to succeed together.
  </p>

  <h2>Future Goals</h2>
  <p>
    In the future, I would like to become more involved in outreach programs that 
    encourage younger students, especially women, explore topics within computer science and engineering. 
    Technology should be accessible to everyone, and I want to help make that possible.
