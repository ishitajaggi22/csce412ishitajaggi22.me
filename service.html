  <h2>English Tutoring</h2>
  <p>
    I have been volunteering online with UCAN (Uniting Children Across Nations) teach underprivileged
    students in Colombia 
    English as a second language. This includes English speaking and grammar. Since I have 
    learned conversational Spanish, I am able to communicate with the students and teach them 
    how to properly speak English.

  <h2>Study Groups</h2>
  <p>
    I enjoy participating in collaborative study sessions where I share resources, 
    walk through coding examples, and answer questions. These group settings create 
    a supportive environment and encourage everyone to succeed together. A great 
    place that I find study groups and people in my classes is through Navigate, since 
    it automatically links to your student account and lets you create study groups 
    with classmates.

  <h2>Future Goals</h2>
  <p>
    In the future, I would like to become more involved in outreach programs that encourage younger 
    students, especially women, explore topics within computer science and engineering. Technology 
    should be accessible to everyone, and I want to help make that possible.
