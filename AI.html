  <h2>AI-Generated Page - How Artificial Intelligence is Transforming Software Engineering</h2>
  <p>
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming an essential part of modern software engineering. 
    For computer science students and future developers, AI is more than just a buzzword— 
    it is a tool that is actively reshaping how we learn, build, and collaborate.
  </p>

  <h3>Coding Assistance</h3>
  <p>
    AI-powered coding assistants can suggest code completions, explain unfamiliar syntax, 
    and even generate small programs from natural language descriptions. This helps students 
    focus on problem-solving instead of getting stuck on syntax errors or boilerplate code.
  </p>

  <h3>Debugging and Testing</h3>
  <p>
    Debugging is one of the most time-consuming parts of development. AI tools can scan 
    through code to identify likely errors, suggest fixes, and even generate automated tests. 
    This reduces frustration and speeds up the development process.
  </p>

  <h3>Collaboration</h3>
  <p>
    Software engineering is rarely a solo activity. AI enhances collaboration by improving 
    version control tools, supporting real-time code reviews, and providing clear 
    documentation from existing code. These features help teams communicate more effectively 
    and keep projects organized.
  </p>

  <h3>Ethical Use</h3>
  <p>
    With the benefits of AI also come important responsibilities. Students and professionals 
    must consider ethical concerns such as bias in algorithms, data privacy, and responsible 
    use of AI-generated code. Understanding these challenges is key to building software 
    that is both innovative and trustworthy.
